# ChatGPT-Transcription-Analysis
AI Prompt Engineer to assist with analyzing transcriptions of consultant presentations. Your role will involve creating effective AI prompts for ChatGPT to identify the key points discussed and highlight any critical points that were missed. This is a unique opportunity to contribute to our understanding of presentation effectiveness through AI-driven insights. If you have a strong background in AI prompt engineering and experience with ChatGPT, we would love to hear from you.
=================
To create an AI-driven tool that analyzes transcriptions of consultant presentations, you'll need to leverage OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-4 API. The goal is to identify key points from transcriptions and highlight critical points that may have been missed. This can be done by creating effective prompts that guide the model to extract relevant information, summarize key concepts, and identify gaps.

Here’s a Python script to help you get started:
Prerequisites:

    Install the openai library:

    pip install openai

    Set up an API key with OpenAI (You'll need this to access the GPT model).

Python Code:

import openai
import re

# Set your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'

# Function to generate AI prompts to analyze consultant presentation
def generate_analysis_prompt(transcription):
    """
    Generates an AI prompt for ChatGPT to extract key points and missed details from a presentation transcription.
    
    :param transcription: The transcription of the presentation (string).
    :return: A string that includes the task for ChatGPT to extract key points.
    """
    prompt = f"""
    I have a transcription of a consultant's presentation. Your task is to do the following:
    1. Identify the key points discussed in the presentation.
    2. Highlight any critical points or insights that were missed or inadequately discussed.
    3. Provide a summary of the most important takeaways.
    4. Give suggestions for improving the presentation based on the missing details.
    
    The transcription is as follows:
    "{transcription}"
    
    Please perform the tasks and return the analysis.
    """
    return prompt

# Function to interact with the GPT model and analyze the transcription
def analyze_transcription_with_ai(transcription):
    """
    This function sends the transcription to the OpenAI API and gets an analysis of key points and missed details.
    
    :param transcription: The transcription of the presentation (string).
    :return: Analysis result from GPT model.
    """
    # Generate the analysis prompt
    prompt = generate_analysis_prompt(transcription)

    # Call OpenAI API to analyze the transcription using ChatGPT
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can use "gpt-3.5-turbo" or any other engine
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=1000,  # Adjust the number of tokens as per the requirement
        temperature=0.7,  # Control the randomness of the output
        top_p=1.0,  # Sampling from the full distribution
        frequency_penalty=0.0,
        presence_penalty=0.0
    )

    # Extract the result from the API response
    analysis = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return analysis

# Example transcription (Replace this with actual transcription text)
transcription_example = """
In today's presentation, we are going to discuss the importance of AI in business. The key point is that AI can help automate tasks, which increases efficiency. We will also talk about how AI can predict market trends and help in decision-making. There are several use cases in industries like healthcare, finance, and retail. However, the challenges include data privacy concerns and the potential for job displacement. AI will revolutionize industries, but we must be cautious about its impacts on the workforce.

# Perform AI analysis on the transcription
analysis_result = analyze_transcription_with_ai(transcription_example)

# Print the analysis result
print("AI Analysis of Presentation:\n")
print(analysis_result)

Code Breakdown:

    generate_analysis_prompt: This function creates the prompt for GPT to analyze the transcription. The prompt instructs the model to:
        Identify key points discussed.
        Highlight any critical points that were missed.
        Provide a summary of key takeaways.
        Suggest improvements based on the missing or inadequately discussed points.

    analyze_transcription_with_ai: This function sends the transcription and prompt to OpenAI’s GPT model using the openai.Completion.create method, requesting the model to analyze the transcription according to the instructions defined in the prompt.

    transcription_example: This is an example transcription that you can replace with real consultant presentation data. It simulates a presentation about AI’s role in business.

    API Integration: The script interacts with OpenAI's API to send the prompt and retrieve an analysis of the transcription.

Example Output:

When the model receives the prompt, it might return something like the following:
